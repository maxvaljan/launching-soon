# MaxMove App – Web UI Place Order Page Error

Recently, we replaced **Mapbox** integration with **Google Maps** in the MaxMove web UI (on the "Place Order" page). After deployment, we started seeing the following error message:

> **Something went wrong**  
> We're sorry, but something went wrong on our end. Our team has been notified and is working to fix the issue.

Below are the relevant logs detailing the error:

FIND THE ISSUE AND MAKE A PLAN TO FIX IT; IN THE FOLLOWING YOPU FIND SOME SUGGESTIONS

- **500 Server Error**: Indicates the server is unable to handle the request properly. This could be triggered by a misconfiguration in the new integration or a mismatch in the code that references Google Maps instead of Mapbox.
- **ReferenceError: Cannot access uninitialized variable**: This error typically occurs in JavaScript when a variable is used before being declared or defined.  
  - It may indicate a missing or incomplete initialization sequence that was overlooked during the switch from Mapbox to Google Maps.
  - Could also be related to environment variables or configuration settings that were never properly declared/loaded before they are used.

---

## Possible Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Integration Logic**  
   - Parts of the old Mapbox configuration might still be referenced in code, causing unexpected behavior when the new Google Maps code attempts to run.

2. **Uninitialized Variable or Missing Config**  
   - A required API key or configuration setting might not be loaded into the environment, leading to an undefined reference when the code tries to access it.

3. **Build or Bundle Issue**  
   - The build process might still reference certain Mapbox scripts, or it hasn’t been properly updated to include the new Google Maps dependencies.

---

## Proposed Fix

1. **Check Configuration & Environment Variables**  
   - Verify that all Google Maps configuration variables (API keys, initialization options, endpoints) are correctly set and accessible in the environment. GOOGLE MAPS api key is set correctly in vercel (frontend deployment), and railway where backend is deployed
   - Remove or disable any leftover Mapbox keys or code references to avoid conflicts.

2. **Review Initialization Code**  
   - Ensure the Google Maps integration is fully initialized before any calls are made.  
   - Look for any variable references (especially regarding the map object) that might still rely on Mapbox.


## Conclusion

The **"Cannot access uninitialized variable"** error strongly suggests a problem in how the new Google Maps integration code is initialized or referenced. By reviewing and correcting environment variables/configurations, properly initializing objects, cleaning out legacy Mapbox code, and testing thoroughly, we can resolve these errors and restore full functionality to the MaxMove web UI "Place Order" page.
