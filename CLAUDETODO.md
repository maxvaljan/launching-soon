Task: Integrate Waitlist Signup into Web UI Frontend

Description:

A simple waitlist signup Next.js project has been added to the monorepo directory. This needs to be fully integrated into our main web UI frontend.

Requirements:

Implement the waitlist signup section as a second section on the web UI frontend.

Position it below the hero section and above the 'Your 24/7 delivery partner' section.

Maintain a design and styling close to the original.

Ensure full ** logic and functionality is implemented but duplicated unnescessary files and packages we already have in our repo or css and styling doesnt need to be copied

use maxmoves standard colors 

integrate it seamless in our monorepo structure, that after implementing we can delete the unnecessary files which we dont need from   waitlist signup
