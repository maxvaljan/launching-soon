# MaxMove App - Web UI Place Order Page Error Fix

## Problem Overview
The "Place Order" page in the MaxMove web UI was showing the following error after switching from Mapbox to Google Maps integration:

> **Something went wrong**  
> We're sorry, but something went wrong on our end. Our team has been notified and is working to fix the issue.

The key error message was:
```
ReferenceError: Cannot access uninitialized variable.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the code was attempting to access Google Maps API objects before they were fully initialized. Specifically:

1. The code accessed `window.google.maps` without properly checking if it exists
2. The page tried to use Google Maps objects even when the loading process wasn't complete
3. No proper error handling was in place to gracefully handle initialization failures

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Map Component (`Map.tsx`)
- Added checks for `!isLoaded || !window.google` before accessing Google Maps API
- Added try/catch block to handle map manipulation errors gracefully
- Made Google Maps object references safer with optional chaining (`window.google?.maps?`)
- Added a fallback center position if there are errors manipulating the map

### 2. Enhanced Google Maps Loader Configuration (`page.tsx`)
- Added additional parameters to make the Google Maps loader more resilient:
  - Added retries (3) to ensure multiple attempts to load the API
  - Added empty nonce to avoid potential CSP issues

### 3. Improved Place Selection Error Handling
- Added try/catch around place selection logic to prevent unhandled exceptions
- Added user-friendly error messages when place selection fails

### 4. Enhanced Error Display
- Improved the error message shown to users when Google Maps fails to load
- Added additional debug logging to help identify the source of API key issues

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify the page loads correctly when Google Maps API key is valid
- [ ] Verify the map displays and renders correctly
- [ ] Test address selection and route calculation functionality
- [ ] Test with network disruptions to ensure error handling works as expected
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly and helpful

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing a Map fallback mode that works without Google Maps
2. Add better telemetry for monitoring Map-related errors
3. Implement proper validation of the Google Maps API key on application startup

## Additional Notes
- The Google Maps API key should be set as an environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Ensure the API key has the required permissions for Maps JavaScript API and Places API
- Ensure the API key is properly restricted to prevent unauthorized usage
